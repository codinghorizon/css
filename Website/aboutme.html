                    <p>
                      I was born in <a style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1);">1996</a> in Nordenham, near Bremen, in Germany. <br>
                      I grew up in a small village inside Nordenham, Blexen, until I was 19 years old.
                      Blexen is, still, a nice place to live.
                      Since there are only about 3000 people living there, it is pretty quiet in Blexen, which brings advantages and disadvantages.
                      On the one hand everything is peaceful and there are stronger relationships between neighbors or other contacts.
                      On the other hand, if a 10yr old guy is messing things up it does actually not take long until your parents know ;-)<br><br>
                      In Blexen I went to the "VGS Blexen", VGS means something like "reliable elementary school", not really interesting.
                      When I was 10 years old I went to the Gymnasium, which is kind of Germany's academic high school.
                      Through years of studying I met a lot of people, friends that are still (more than 10 years later!) some of my best friends.
                      This is actually not usual nowadays, as soon as I know. Most youth people do have maybe one or two longstanding buddies and that's it.<br>
                      Anyway, in <a style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1);">2014</a> I took my A-levels - successfully.<br><br>
                      Right after that I started a voluntary social year in the Jahnhalle Nordenham, which is one of two event buildings in our city.
                      I was responsible for all kind of lights on events aswell as setting up the stage with electrical stuff, microphones, speakers, scenery and so on.
                      Through the week we prepared events by filling fridges with drinks and stuff and if needed setting up audiences tables for revues.
                      In this year I gained lots of self consciousness due to the contact with many artists and visitors.
                      Also these were my first steps in work life, seriously, a great start! I can recommend that to everybody who finished his school education. <br><br>
                      In October, <a style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1);">2015</a>, I started studying on the university of Nordhausen and lived there for about a year. More about that in my "IT education" section.
                      Last but not least I started my apprenticeship as an IT specialist in Oldenburg, which I am still in. Also, more about this in the next section.

                    <p>
                      I have always been interested in IT, Informatics and some parts of programming.<br>
                      I think this is a classic story of father's influence.
                      As long as I remember, my father was really interested in technology and engineering of any kind.
                      Technology in terms of electrical stuff, handcraft aswell as computers. This led me to being interested in that, too.
                      I liked watching him working with grinders, flexes or chainsaws and hearing the screeching when I was about 6 years old.
                      Also, it was so interesting for me to see when he installed programs on his computer or creating Invitations in MS Word.
                      When I was 11 years old I got my first own computer and my first game was the "shooter game" Moorhuhn.
                      From this on I wasted a lot of time on my computer, installing newer operating systems and later on started basic programming with Visual Basic etc.
                      So I decided to take this as my profession and started the study in Nordhausen (2015), called "Internet - Applications and Technologies".
                      This was really interesting but to be honest I missed the practical working parts for "learning by doing".
                      First I tried a lot of things at home after courses but that was not what I wanted.<br><br>
                      So after one year, in mid <a style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1);">2016</a>, I decided to do an apprenticeship and this is where I am now.<br>
                      I applied in many cities near my hometown Nordenham, I didn't really like the part of Germany where I lived when I was studying in Nordhausen.
                      Finally I had three companies where I was invited for job interviews and two of them offered me to start my apprenticeship there.
                      I had the choice between Bremen and Oldenburg, which already led me a bit more to Oldenburg since this is the nicer city - from my point of view.
